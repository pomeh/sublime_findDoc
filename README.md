This is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugins that allows you to search the documentation on your favorites urls.

### How to install
The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

Or you can download the zip archive and unzip in your packages directory (by Preferences->Browse Packages...).

### How to configure
The default shortcut to call the plugin is : (`ctrl + shift + d`).
The default used url is : (`http://devdocs.io/#q=%s`).

But you can set multiple shortcuts and urls by your key bindings.

Highlight the function to search and use the shortcut to open a new tab.

If you don't highlight text, the plugin selects the current word at cursor by camelCase.
